A light-weight, in-process HTTP simulator for easy functional testing.

Usage
-----
```c#
//  Start the simulator on http://localhost:3000
using (var simulator = Simulator.Start(3000))
{
    //  Configure a response for "/greeting"
    simulator.Responses.Add(
        new Response(
            rule: r => r.RequestUri.PathAndQuery == "/greeting",
            message: new HttpResponseMessage
            {
                StatusCode = HttpStatusCode.OK,
                Content = new StringContent("Hello World"),
            }
        )
    );

    //  Go ahead and visit http://localhost:3000/greeting in your browser...
    WebRequest
        .Create("http://localhost:3000/greeting")
        .GetResponse().Dispose();

    //  The simulator collects any requests for verification later
    var request = simulator.Requests.Single();

    Console.WriteLine(request.Method);
    Console.WriteLine(request.RequestUri);
    Console.WriteLine(request.Content);        
}
```
